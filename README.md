# Washing Machine code.

This is a code intended to control a Colormaq Washing Machine 11 Kg with an
arduino uno. 

## Schematic

The mainboard of my washing machine fried after a electrical surge. I
discovered that the TRIACs were still working so I made a board that could fire
their triggers using an Arduino. The schematic is provided in this repository.
