# Washing Machine code

This is a code intended to control a Colormaq Washing Machine 11 Kg with an
arduino uno. 

The messages in the 20x4 LCD display are written in Portuguese, but the
comments and the serial messages are all in English.

## Schematic

The mainboard of my washing machine fried after a electrical surge. I
discovered that the TRIACs were still working so I made a board that could fire
their triggers using an Arduino. The schematic is provided in this repository.
